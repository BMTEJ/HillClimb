# HillClimb

This was a 6 hour project that involved using Lingua Franca for deterministic behavior that is modeled as a FSM with reactors and modes.

The code we wrote is in the HillClimb.lf file as well as the Tilt.lf file. The other files were provided and were used to speed up development as opposed to us implementing acceleromoter and gyro angle functions.
